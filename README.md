# DNA-Pattern-Matching
Analysing different pattern-searching algorithms when finding for substring occurrences in a given DNA main string 

## Problem Statement 
Give a long DNA string, find all occurrences of a chosen substring

## Functionality
1. Implemented three different algorithms: Finite Automata (FA) algorithm, Boyer Moore Horspool algorithm and the Naive/Brute Force algorithm
2. Calculated and compared time complexities for the three different algorithms on different sizes of main DNA string and substrings

## Conclusion

1. FA algorithm is more suitable to be used for general pattern searching and has a stable time complexity regardless of the size of the main DNA string and the substrings 
2. Boyer Moore Horspool algorithm is more suitable for substrings with a few types of characters. Otherwise, this has a similar time complexity to the Naive/Brute Force algorithm
